			+ "If you click on a tile with a mine, and you do not "
			+ "have any more lives, you lose. "
			+ "Tiles with numbers (1-8) indicate how many bombs are "
			+ "immediately adjacent to that tile (touching a side "
			+ "or a corner of that tile). "
			+ "If you click on a tile and an empty square appears, "
			+ "it indicates that no bombs are immediately adjacent "
			+ "to that tile, and so all surrounding tiles "
			+ "will be displayed. "
			+ "The objective is to fill in all non-mine tiles by "
			+ "clicking them (and optionally flagging the mine tiles). "
			+ "To flag a tile you think is a mine, point and right-click. "
			+ "To unflag a tile you previously flagged, point and right-click again. "
			+ "You can click a numbered tile after it is initially opened "
			+ "to display all adjacent tiles if the correct number of "
			+ "flags have been placed (and/or mines hit in extra-lives "
			+ "mode) on surrounding tiles. "
			+ "Tiles on the edge of the board have fewer adjacent tiles "
			+ "(the board does not wrap around the edges). "
			+ "The number of mines minus the number of flags used, the number "
			+ "of lives left (if applicable), and the time passed are "
			+ "displayed at the top of the game.\n"
